## About the Dog Class:

A dog object can be constructed with an `age` and a `name`. If no age is provided, the `age` should start as 1. 

Typically, one dog year is 7 people years.  So, a dog that is 7 years old is 49 in people years. However, this number varies depending on the breed.

For this program, one dog year is worth `x` number of people years.  The scale value of each dog year will be provided via a parameter to the `getDogYears` method.
